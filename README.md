# Text-Game
My name is Kristopher Fierro-Marin and this is just a side project.
This is just a small-scale text-based project that I've been considering but have put off.

The main things I'd like to add to this are:
Being able to choose which class you would like to be. A turn based combat system. 

The ability to level up and gain skill points (to increase a player's stats.)

And create a story that can draw users in.

Evenetually I want to add a wweapons system, potions, a mana system, abilities and modifiers to weapons and to enemies

But we should wait until I get the base feature first; we can worry about the wants later.

(These are nice to have but not required.)

And if possible, make it so players can save and load stats later.

Thanks for checking this out!
