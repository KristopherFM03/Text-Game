# Text-Game
My name is Kristopher Fierro-Marin and this is just a side project.
This is just a small-scale text-based project that I've been considering but have put off.

The main things I'd like to add to this are:
(These are the needs.)
There are two classes to choose from: fighter and guardian. (Two classes so I can focus on two classes rather than 9+)
A turn based combat system
The ability to level up and gain skill points (to increase a player's stats)
And create a story that can draw users in.

Evenetually I want to add

(These are our wants.)
Weapons system
Potions
A mana system
Abilities
Modifiers to weapons and to enemies
But we should wait until I get the base feature first; we can worry about the wants later.

(These are nice to have but not required.
And if possible, make it so players can save and load stats later.
This program will help me improve and learn new and old ideas.

Thanks for checking this out!
